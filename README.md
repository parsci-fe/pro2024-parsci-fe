## Introduction

Parañaque Science High School’s team for the Future Engineers category has a two-wheel drive, specifically a front-wheel drive, vehicle which utilized an AISTEAM unit

The coding software used to code the self-driving car the team has was AIcode. Since Nashenbot’s AISTEAM unit was used by the members to build the vehicle, that was the coding language that had to be used. The coding of the vehicle consists of ___ modules that perform the appropriate actions and tasks the self-driving car must accomplish. The crucial components of the vehicle include two Infrared Barrier Avoidance sensors or modules, a Camera or Visual sensor, two encoder motors, one ordinary motor, and one rudder module. Through the utilization of the Infrared Barrier Avoidance modules and the Visual or camera sensor, managing through the obstacles became possible. It is also powered by AISTEAM’s lithium battery module and controller.

The process of building the vehicle was a drawn-out process, but after being mainly inspired by Formula 1 (F1) racing cars and Nashenbot’s 2021 Rank 9 for the global Future Engineers category, the final design of the vehicle was finally decided on. The materials to build the self-driving car were all from the AISTEAM unit kit, with the two wheels at the front coming from the LEGO EV3 unit. The new robot unit from Nashenbot was thus used to its full potential by the team. 

The code making process was also drawn-out as the members had a hard time figuring out how the visual or camera sensor worked, but through trial-and-error and the various code examples provided by Nashenbot upon downloading the needed files for the AIcode software, the team pushed through with their various hypotheses in making the code to come up with the final one that the vehicle would utilize to complete the tasks and missions for the rounds.

There are not many technicalities in making the code as block coding was used and not script coding. AISTEAM, from the name itself, is also equipped with Artificial Intelligence (AI), making the coding process easier. The only problem was even if there were reference codes, most of them did not include what the vehicle needed, so they were only really used as references and nothing more. The team’s code was produced and edited from scratch.
